# Notes Requirements

1. Responsive Layout
   - Design the app to provide a responsive layout that works well across various device screen sizes.
   - The app should display:
     - 1 column for small devices (e.g., phones in portrait mode).
     - 2 or 3 columns for larger screens (e.g., tablets or phones in landscape mode).
2. Add Notes
   - Users should be able to add notes to the application, allowing them to jot down important information quickly and effortlessly.
3. Remove Notes
   - Provide a functionality to delete notes that are no longer needed.
4. Sort Notes
   - Implement functionality to sort notes by date to help users organize and retrieve their information efficiently.
5. Search Notes
   - Include a search feature that allows users to search for specific text within their notes.
6. Infinite Scroll
   - Handle a large number of notes by implementing infinite scrolling, ensuring smooth navigation through the list of notes.
7. Dynamic Background
   - Add a randomly generated background for the application to enhance its visual appeal.
8. Date Stamps
   - Display a date stamp at the bottom of each note to indicate when it was created.
9. Persistent Data
   - Ensure that the notes persist across app restarts using a local database (e.g., Room, SQLite) or shared preferences.
10. Optional: Cloud Sync
   - Include a feature to sync notes with Firebase Firestore or another cloud solution.
